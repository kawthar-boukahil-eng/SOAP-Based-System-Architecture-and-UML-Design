# SOAP-Based System Architecture and UML Design

This repository showcases the design of a distributed system architecture using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The work highlights the integration of two distinct applications managing administrative and research data for academic staff, facilitated through web services.

## Features and Highlights
- **Web Service Communication:** Demonstrates the application of SOAP for seamless data exchange between applications.
- **UML Modeling:** Includes detailed UML diagrams such as:
  - Static Context Diagrams
  - Use Case Diagrams
  - Class Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams
- **Database Design:** Provides schemas for database structures tailored to the application's needs.

## Project Scope
1. **Application 1:** Handles administrative management, including:
   - Staff authentication
   - Personnel data management
   - Career promotions
2. **Application 2:** Focuses on research management, covering:
   - Research staff information
   - Research career promotions
3. **Integration via SOAP:** Both applications interact through a SOAP-based web service to ensure data consistency and avoid redundancy.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Java J2EE**: Core development platform
- **Eclipse IDE**: Development environment
- **Apache Axis2**: Web service framework
- **Oracle SQL Developer**: Database management
- **Visual Paradigm**: UML modeling
- **LaTeX**: Documentation and report preparation
